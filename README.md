The project is supervised by Dr. Russell. I used CMB-GC to analyze the different sources' contributions for PM2.5 in North Carolina between 2002 to 2010. I used d3.js and ArcGIS to visualize the model's result. The project is still undergoing and we are preparing to submit the final result to a journal.

Build a local server to run d3.js and have fun to see how things change in NC and some scientific facts.
